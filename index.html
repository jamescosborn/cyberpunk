      <p> What does it mean to be human? How do we decide which path to take along the journey of our lives? On the streets of Velvet City a homeless android begs for enough bit coin to buy himself some code.  Around the corner a SCorp enforcer takes down a Terminal Tom for peddling illegal code. The city is full of stories.... this is yours.</p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <p>You sit alone at your desk and count the minutes. Five minutes before you need to get on the beat.</p>
        <p>As you start to lean back in your chair and count the ceiling tiles, your trapper keeper chimes a developing news alert. <div class="blockquote"><strong>"Neural Crash causes millions to fall into coma - Is your brain potato safe?"</strong><footer class="blockquote-footer">5 million views</footer></div></p>
        <p>Your stomach flapjacks as the fear slowly starts to creep in and shake you to the core.</p>
        <p>'This is bad, <span class="player-name"></span>,' you say to yourself... This is real bad.</p>
        <p>The neural link, AKA "the brain potato," is arguably the most important innovation of the 21st century. No longer is nature the gatekeeper to untapped potential.</p>
        <p>The brain potato levels the playing field. It allows users to access, store, and recall  any data type instantaneously. Rich, poor, young, old… everyone has one these days. Most get the implant directly after birth.</p>
        <p>You can’t help but wonder… Will you be safe?</p>
        <p>"Time to begin work <span class="player-name"></span>!" the trapper keeper chimes as the clock read 8am.</p>
        <p>“Same stuff… different day,” you mutter to yourself. The last thing you want to do is spend all day writing full pieces. All you can think about is the event the Journalists are calling “The Crash.”
        You reach for your trapper keeper to get started for the day.. Then you have a thought… maybe you should reach out to some contacts… see if you can learn more about the crash.</p>

      <h1 class="customfont">The Grisly Grotto, 5:30 p.m.</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>You really don’t want to get involved with something like that. If it was important, your boss would of been making as much of a deal out of it as the CyberBall playoffs he had you covering  last week. Still, you can’t shake the feeling that there was more too it than what SCorp was playing it off as, thousands of people shouldn’t just shut off like that.</p>
        <p>You decide it would be better if you just forgot about all of it at the bottom of a drink, so after clocking out and putting on your jacket, you get on your hoverbike and head straight for the bar. The bar you frequent, the Grisly Grotto, is a sort of classy joint. Music from long before the Restructuring echoes through the room, giving the place a very nostalgic vibe.</p>
        <p>After getting your usual drink - a glass of Kirin - and settle in. You reflect on the chaotic day, what with half the newsroom empty because of the Crash. The Bartender, Gabe, wasn’t saying as much as he usually does, but just as you finish your drink he leans in and asks “I got something interesting for you, Newsman”</p>

        <p><span needsflag = "flag-chaos">"Newsman", You scoff at the term, a Newsman’s only purpose is to write whatever SCorp tells them too, you find it hard to be worthy of term. Regardless,</span><span needsflag="flag-order">You nod, Newsman was the term for anyone contracted by SCorp to write stories for Velvet city, and even if you had doubts about what’s written, that was your job.</span> Gabe has been a good contact and friend to you, so generally whenever he gets like this, it means he’s got something he thinks you should write about. Not that SCorp would ever approve of his stories. “Gabe, look, it’s been a rough day, you can tell me about it later, but for now, can you just refill this”? You hand him your empty cup.</p>
        <p>“That’s just the thing” Gabe says, taking your cup.</p>
        <p>“I want to tell you something about today”. Gabe says as he fills your glass and places before you. ou take a sip before replying.</p>
        <p>“You mean the Crash?”  you ask, your curiosity piqued. He nods and reaches under the counter, retrieving a small storage unit, it had the red text <span class="kowabunga">ENCRYPTED</span> displayed on it’s screen.</p>
        <p>“Someone came by earlier, he said that if I saw you, I should give this to you. Said it had something to do with the Crash.” Gabe explained, but that didn’t make sense to you. Who was this man, and had he wanted to send him information, why would it be on a physical drive? He could just send him a message through his Brain Potato. Still, you nod at Gabe and reach over to take the Drive, but when you try to take it Gabe holds on to it and gives you a serious look.</p>
        <p>“This seems big, <span class="player-name"></span>, I don’t know what’s on that drive, but the man who left it for you had a dangerous look about him.” </p>
        <p>You nod at gave and he lets you take the drive “Don’t worry gabe” You reassure him as you finish your drink and head for the entrance. Even though you're not too keen on the crash, you can’t help but be curious about it. You can’t stop thinking about it on your way home.</p>

      <h1 class="customfont" >Westwood Park - 5:30 p.m.</h1>
      <div class="textbox">
        <p>The Crash is still in your mind; you can’t stop thinking about it. You go to Westwood Park to try to relax, but the old, dying trees and tainted sunlight give you no comfort. People mill by at a listless pace, gas masks over their faces.</p>
        <p>Why did all those people crash? Is it going to happen again, or to <i>you</i>? You feel sick, uneasy, like you have to get to the bottom of this. One of your old chummers from academy might know. You heard he’d got a pretty nice gig with SCorp as an ICE controller. The park is now deserted, and seems sad, haunted. You stomp at a rat that scurries by your feet.</p>
        <p>Ehh, it’s worth a shot. You call up Zephyr Dionikes on your vidphone.</p>
        <p>“<span class="player-name"></span>, what’s going down?”</p>
        <p>“Hey, Zephyr. You know anything about the Crash? I can’t stop thinking about it,” you say.</p>
        <p>Zephyr stays silent for a few minutes. “<span class="player-name"></span>, don’t look too close." <p>That’s my advice. Go to your job tomorrow, try to be happy, find a date this weekend.”</p>
        <p>“Zeph, tell me. I need to know. What happened?”</p>
        <p>He takes a moment to rub his furrowed brow. <span class="kowabunga">ENCRYPTED</span> flashes onto the screen. “Fine, you asked for it. Look into SCorp's repositories for the latest firmware update.” The line disconnects... He looked really concerned. It’s been a long day. Whatever Zeph pointed me towards, it’s probably not good. Time to get back home. As you walk, you see someone down and out slumped next to a tree.</p>

        <p>You try and focus on anything EXCEPT for the tip you just learned, but you can’t seem to push it out of you mind. What had him so worked up? Is there something nefarious related to “The Crash.”</p>
        <p>“DING FLOOR 200!” the mag lift announces. </p>
        <p>You step into the desolate hall of your apartment floor and make your way to door 200e2. The room is nearly empty save a bed, a nightstand, and a vintage Felix the Cat alarm clock from the '90s. The techno greasy glow of the magenta city scape illuminates cold room. You take a moment and finally decide that you need to know what is being hidden from the public about “The Crash”.</p>
        <p>You set the brain potato to twice stuffed and frame jack into the SCorp repositories. You execute a bit of custom script and find something unusual. An error in the commit log for the latest neural link software update. There are several lines that are redacted. You dig deeper into the problem, only to discover the horrifying truth…</p>
        <p>A bug. A nasty one. And even worse, SCorp knew it was going to happen, and they did nothing to stop it.</p>
        <p>This could be the end of SCorp if anyone finds out…</p>
        <p>"You have a new message, <span class="player-name"></span>," chimes your Trapper Keeper.</p>

        <p>It seems as though you can't escape the wrath of SCorp. You make a mad dash and catch the mag lift at the opposite side of the room. They chase you out of the building and through a network of alleys. You try to evade the omnipresence of wires devouring the cityscape. The tangle you up, slowing you down. The SCorp enforcers are hot on your tail.</p>
        <p>As you extricate yourself from the electric brine with your laser blade, and begin to run again a stranger pulls you in from a side door of a store front.</p>
        <p><i>"Oh no... SCorp has me now"</i> you think.

        a security alarm screams into your ear, <i>“Security channel compromised”.</i></p>

        <p><i>“Oh shit”</i>  you whisper…</p>

        <p>Any moment SCorp goons could break into your apartment, grab you, and lock you away never to be heard from again.</p>

        <p>Trapper keeper in hand your make a mad dash for the door. As you step into the hallway you see a large shadowy figure at the end.</p>

        <p>SCorp works quick. You make a mad dash for the mag lift and hit the button for the basement. The shadowy figure sprints to the lift door as it close inches before his face.</p>

        <p>As the lift races to the basement you start to panic…
        Where can you go? Who can you trust?
        You send you journalist contact a message <i>“Help, SCorp is on my tail”</i></p>

      <div class="textbox">
        <p>In the early 21st century Velvet City was a major port located on a bustling waterway. By 2099 the river had been diverted to serve other SCorp interests. The dried up canals became The Velvet Underground. A haven for people looking to get lost.</p>

        <p>You arrive at Block E, 5th avenue access hatch and key in the code <i>“xeon”.</i></p>

        <p>You step into the small dimly lit room.</p>

        <p><i>“We need to talk”</i> you say to the journalist.</p>

        <p><i>“Then talk”</i> he replies.</p>

        <p>You two discuss the need for a New World Order. You both agree that SCorp intentionally released faulty software and needs to be held accountable. Yet, you fear that the panic incited could cause global pandemonium. While the journalist seems intent on setting the world ablaze… you still have pause. Will you help the journalist expose the truth?</p>

      <p>Something perturbs you. You realize you have seen this journalist before. It seems as if you crossed paths at a local seafood restaurant. He was in a bathroom stall and abruptly left with a viscous terrier under his arm while you were washing your hands. You decide this "Journalist" can't be trusted. You need to turn him in.</p>
      <p>The Journalist's lack of hygiene offended you immensely. But what happened after that was much worse. You witnessed him meticulously licking his fingers while eating a plate of shrimp. The act flayed all your senses. So you made the decision to turn him in.</p>
      <p>Several android enforcers enter the bar and take seats all around you. You order a drink for the one sitting next to you, saying nothing.</p>
      <p><i>"You did the right thing,"</i> they say.<p>
      <p><i>"I figured the evil I know is better than the one I didn't,"</i> you say.</p>
      <p>You spend a few more hours at the bar, then head back home. You turn on your favorite reality TV show, "Climbing for Dollars."</p>
      <p>It doesn't give you much satisfaction. You snap off the TV, climb in to bed, and think about the madness you discovered today.</p>

      <p>It’s fight or flight time. Live or die. You climb out the window onto the rickety fire escape and shimmy your way down to your ‘85 Wizzer parked on the street below.</p>
      <p>Finally you get it started, and take off at speed. Your heart is pounding; you’ve never felt like this before. Is it the end?</p>
      <p>All of the sudden, two black SUVs pull up and block the intersection. Panic races through your body. You turn the bike around and attempt to go the other way, but 4 other SUVs pull up to block the opposite side of the street. The jig is up. You’re geeked.</p>
      <p>You dismount your bike, take off your helmet, and stare down your oppressors.
      Androids in black suits begin piling out of the vehicles. How do so many fit inside?</p>
      <p>“People deserve to know!” you shout, “We’re awake now!”</p>
      <p>They form a circle surrounding you. There must be 100… They stand alert, silent.</p>
      <p>Was it worth it? This is what humanity needed to expose SCorp, you tell yourself. Millions of brains wiped by a blank master copy in the blink of an eye. For what? The potatoes made life better, but now...</p>
